# CNN Image Classification with PyTorch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the MNIST dataset and PyTorch. The model achieves high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**: A CNN with two convolutional layers, dropout regularization, and two fully connected layers.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Functions to train and evaluate the model on the MNIST dataset, with performance metrics such as loss and accuracy.
- **GPU Support**: The model supports GPU acceleration if available.
- **Visualization**: Code to visualize sample test images along with their predicted labels.

## Getting Started
